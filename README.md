## Interesting Article

Article: **https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/it-careers-skills/articles/prompt-engineering-in-programming-software-development/**

This article caught my attention because it highlights how prompt engineering is reshaping the way developers interact with AI models. I find it interesting that writing effective prompts is becoming a skill just as valuable as traditional coding. It’s fascinating to see how companies are integrating AI-assisted development into workflows, making coding more about guiding AI rather than writing every line from scratch. The discussion on how prompt engineering can bridge the gap between technical and non-technical users also stood out to me. I liked how the article broke down the different ways AI is improving software development, from debugging to optimizing code. It made me think about how my own approach to coding might change as AI tools become more advanced. Overall, it was a great read that made me reconsider what “programming” will look like in the future.

I find this discussion pretty interesting. Especially as CS students, it can be hard to hear that anybody can end up doing what we are studying to do. I wonder how much of an advantage it is so still have learned these languages the traditional way is in "prompt engineering." I imagine there still is a significant advantage.
